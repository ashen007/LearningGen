=====================

Probabilistic modeling and inference are core tools in diverse fields including statistics, machine learning, computer
vision, cognitive science, robotics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. implementing inference
algorithms is often difficult and error prone. Gen simplifies the use of probabilistic modeling and inference, by
providing modeling languages in which users express models, and high-level programming constructs that automate
aspects of inference.
